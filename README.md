# Benchmarks for Rust web frameworks

This repository contains easy programs that can be benchmarked using wrk. This gives you an
approximate idea on how they perform. It's still WIP.

Features:

- All frameworks share common dependencies (when possible), by using a Rust workspace
- All frameworks produce an equivalent response
- Static response (ping-pong) benchmarks
- Benchmarks for Actix-web v3, Actix-web v4, Rocket v0.4, Rocket v0.5, Tide and Warp

Things that would be nice to have in the future:

- Benchmarking even more frameworks and versions
- Benchmarking more complex flows than a ping-pong
- Benchmarking with templating engines
- Benchmarking with database access
